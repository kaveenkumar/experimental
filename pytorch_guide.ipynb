# Intro

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a very powerful machine learning framework. Central to PyTorch are [tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html), a generalization of matrices to higher ranks. One intuitive example of a tensor is an image with three color channels: A 3-channel (red, green, blue) image which is 64 pixels wide and 64 pixels tall is a $3\times64\times64$ tensor. You can access the PyTorch framework by writing `import torch` near the top of your code, along with all of your other import statements.

This guide will help introduce you to the functionality of PyTorch, but don't worry too much about memorizing it: the assignments will link to relevant documentation where necessary.


```python
import torch
```
