    "# Threading vs Multiprocessing\n",
    "We have two common approaches to run code in parallel (achieve multitasking and speed up your program) : via threads or via multiple processes.\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "A Process is an instance of a program, e.g. a Python interpreter. They are independent from each other and do not share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key facts:\n",
    "- A new process is started independently from the first process\n",
    "- Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores\n",
    "- Separate memory space\n",
    "- Memory is not shared between processes\n",
    "- One GIL (Global interpreter lock) for each process, i.e. avoids GIL limitation\n",
    "- Great for CPU-bound processing\n",
    "- Child processes are interruptable/killable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting a process is slower that starting a thread\n",
    "- Larger memory footprint\n",
    "- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads\n",
    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution (Also known as \"leightweight process\"). A Process can spawn multiple threads.\n",
    "The main difference is that all threads within a process share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key facts:\n",
    "- Multiple threads can be spawned within one process\n",
    "- Memory is shared between all threads\n",
    "- Starting a thread is faster than starting a process\n",
    "- Great for I/O-bound tasks\n",
    "- Leightweight - low memory footprint\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- One GIL for all threads, i.e. threads are limited by GIL\n",
    "- Multithreading has no effect for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL\n",
    "- Not interruptible/killable -> be careful with memory leaks\n",
    "- increased potential for race conditions"
