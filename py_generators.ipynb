    "# Generators\n",
    "Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed on the fly, returning an object that can be iterated over. Unlike lists, they are lazy and thus produce items one at a time and only when asked. So they are much more memory efficient when dealing with large datasets.  \n",
    "A generator is defined like a normal function but with the `yield` statement instead of `return`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "    yield 3\n",
    "```"
